# visualizing-us-yield-curve-with-polynomial-fit-WIP-
Polynomial Fitting Function of a yield curve, calculating deviations from current spot yields, with 1W and 1M changes plotted alongside to visualise changes across time.

This is a simplified version and intention is to utilise Nelson Siegel Modelling to fit yield curve in due course.
